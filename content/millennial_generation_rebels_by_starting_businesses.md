I dug up this [op-ed][op-ed] from last year. It’s about how today’s 20 and 30
somethings have embraced business more so than any other generation. William
Deresiewicz believes that these young people’s affable demeanor lends itself to
being entrepreneurial. Today’s artists, musicians, craftspeople and geeks are
more likely to have LLCs than peace signs on a poster board. 

Deresiewicz offers a perspective that Millennials (whose spokesperson is the
hipster, for better or worse) are starting businesses because their sunny
disposition matches that of a salesperson.  Like a sales rep, this generation
is looking to make connections, and are sociable and agreeable people. From
there he concludes that having the ability to do something means Millennials
are more apt to do it. 

Millennials are therefore Generation Sell.

Being from this generation, I found the analysis both insightful and a bit
dime-store psychology-ish. 

It’s true, far more people my age are starting businesses (or are open to the
idea) than in generations past. And it’s also true we tend to have those
agreeable salesmen-like qualities. Given the current economic climate however,
our reasons for us starting a business are slightly more [practical][practical]
than that our personalities are suited for it.

What the author fails to realize is we are a generation who does things that
feeds our passion. It’s what we were taught. We could be the guy who is 6’8
that enjoys bicycle repair more than basketball. Or we could be the gifted
violinist that wants nothing more than to be in a tech startup. 

We follow our passion, not our disposition. 

We grew up with gold stars on our foreheads, being told we’re good at
everything and that we should do what we love. While this has created a certain
brand of naivete,  sometimes - in order to accomplish great things - it’s best
we don’t know what we’re up against. 

## Businesses Are People 

So why is there a trend of people in their 20’s and 30’s starting businesses?

We view business differently than past generations did. To us, business isn’t
stigmatized. Business can be just as good as it can be bad. 

Business is bad when we work at the behest of it. We hate when businesses
extract value out of us and retains it for itself. Our stomachs churn when the
only benefits of work are getting a paycheck, clinging to mediocre health
insurance, being allowed two weeks of vacation and being provided nice chair to
sit in where we wait to die. 

In that business model, we are a cog and nothing more.

Business is good when it reflects our personality. When our customers love us.
When we feel like it’s making a dent in the world. Business is good when it
resembles us and works at our behest. 

Our businesses are ones that are human. That are us. 

So we don’t hate business. Hating business makes as much sense as a carpenter
hating his saw. We love when businesses are caring, thoughtful and human.

## A Critical Point in History

We Millennials have found ourselves in a strange point of history.  We have
been presented with two choices in today’s workforce: Become a cog (if we’re so
lucky) or fight.

More and more of us choose to fight.

We fight against large corporations that show resentment towards their
customers. We fight against the punch clock that has ruled our parents’ lives.
We fight against the [Gordon Gecko crede][g]. We fight against the simple
notion that business shouldn’t be the sterile, soulless environment where we
don’t matter.

We fight for us and our businesses. They embody the human spirit that is absent
in large, cold businesses.

So yes, we are nice affable people who have the perfect temperament for
business ownership. And that’s great. However, unbeknownst to most, we are
protesting just like our hippie parents. The difference is our LLC’s are our
poster board.

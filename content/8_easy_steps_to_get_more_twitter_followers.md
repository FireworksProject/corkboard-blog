# 8 Easy Steps to Get More Twitter Followers.

Is your Twitter account lonely? Do you wish people would follow you?  I think I can help.

There are many ways to [build your Twitter following][1], but I'm not going to
cover them all. I'm going to show you how to get more Twitter followers by
effectively communicating a clear message on Twitter...and everything that
entails.

*{N.B. I assume you know the basics of Twitter. If you don't, [Hubspot] has a
great [tutorial on getting started with Twitter][6]. Read that first and then
come back here.}*

## 1. Identify Your Audience
Be laser focused with the audience you want to reach. Don't try to appeal to
everyone. Most people don't care about you and what you have to say. So forget
about them and focus on the ones that do. 

Like I mentioned in my [event marketing][3] post, you should take 5 minutes
and write down a persona of your ideal follower. If you can get in the head of
the potential audience, you will figure out exactly what to tweet. 

To do this, answer questions like:

- Where do they hang out?
- What do they eat?
- What do they look up on the Internet?
- What are their interests?
- How do they spend their money?

It will be the best 5 minutes you spend and will make the next few steps very easy.


## 2. Don't Be Boring
People don't follow boring. They follow interesting. Develop an [interesting
voice][5] for your audience. If you think your own voice is interesting
enough, than use that. If not, figure out one that will type of voice will draw
in the persona you created.

Be interesting. Be bacon. 

## 3. Find Your Audience and Follow them.
Look for people on twitter who you want to target and follow them. If they like
the content you're providing, they will follow you right back. This doesn't
work 100% of the time, but it does work enough. 

## 4. Find Interesting Content and Tweet about It. 
People follow authorities. [Ashton Kutcher][ak] has millions of followers
because he's an authority on his celebrity. [Bill Gates][bg] has millions of
followers because he's an authority on software and his own ventures. 

If you don't have many followers, you're not an athority on anything. You need
to become one.

The fastest way to become an authority on something is to become an authority
on finding stuff. So find content on the Internet that your audience will love.
Here's how:

- [Reddit] is great for finding content. But [subreddits] will help you distill the content you want.
- [Quora] will get answers to questions your audience has.
- [Monitter] makes it easy to find and organize Twiiter hashtags for content your audience wants.  
- [WeFollow] is a decent way to find authorities to follow who produce content for your audience.  

There are upteen different way to do this, but the above is a start. For
example you could find blogs that your audience will love and any other content
the Googles can pull up for you. If you happen to be an actual authority on
what you're tweeting about, create a blog and tweet your own material. Just
remember, share only the content your potential audience will love.

So follow the authorities, find content your potential followers will love and
start tweeting.

## 5. Tweet to Grow
Use hashtags, @mentions and links in every single tweet and make every tweet
readable.

### Hashtags.
Find the hashtags your audience uses and put them in your tweets. Chances are
members of your audience are using hashtags to find stuff on the Twitter. So
give them the opportunity to find your tweets, follow you and RT your tweets.

It's best if you work the hashtag into the content of the tweet. But if that's
not possible, just stick it in on the end. 

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p><a href="https://twitter.com/search/%23Critique">#Critique</a> appreciated!<a href="http://t.co/MyhLpxc7" title="http://goo.gl/8uXj9">goo.gl/8uXj9</a> Corkboard Prototype for <a href="https://twitter.com/search/%23Somerville">#Somerville</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/search/%23Alb">#Alb</a> is built!

<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

### @Mentions
I love to be mentioned in tweets. I bet you do too.

@mentions are the best way to let people know you're there and they will
appreciate you mentioning them (so long as it's flattering). Proving @mentions
gives them the opportunity to read your bio and RT what you tweeted about. 

**Tip #1** If you happen to be @mentioning someone who has a lot of followers,
they probably won't acknowledge you. However, there is a good chance some of
their followers are searching their twitter handle. So you might grab some
followers by twitter osmosis. It's worth doing.

**Tip #2** If you're sharing a post written by someone on Twitter, make sure to give them credit with “via”:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>Competitive story telling about the <a href="https://twitter.com/search/%23MBTA">#MBTA</a> at Story Slam <a href="http://t.co/nwsjDIYG" title="http://goo.gl/14p0K">goo.gl/14p0K</a> by @<a href="https://twitter.com/massmouth">massmouth</a> 1/26 at 3pm at Rosebuds. via @<a href="https://twitter.com/steveannear">steveannear</a></p>&mdash; Somerville Corkboard (@Ville_Crkbrd) <a href="https://twitter.com/Ville_Crkbrd/status/291899949438881792" data-datetime="2013-01-17T13:29:05+00:00">January 17, 2013</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
 
They might not follow you right away, but if you help promote their content, they might over time.

### Links
Text can be entertaining, but finding links is why people use Twitter. Make
sure there is a link or a picture in every single tweet you distribute. The
more interesting content you share, the greater chance you'll have to get
followers.

### Make Tweets Readable
There is such a thing as including too many hashtags, links and @mentions. I
did a search for tweets for #art. 

This is a bad tweet.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p><a href="https://twitter.com/search/%23puzzle">#puzzle</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/search/%23vinyl">#vinyl</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/search/%23fun">#fun</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/search/%23instapuzzle">#instapuzzle</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/search/%23weekend">#weekend</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/search/%23art">#art</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/search/%23colors">#colors</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/search/%23records">#records</a> <a href="http://t.co/l8rZoat1" title="http://instagr.am/p/UwWTwIgVyN/">instagr.am/p/UwWTwIgVyN/</a></p>&mdash; Tara(@coth_t) <a href="https://twitter.com/coth_t/status/293426757711843328" data-datetime="2013-01-21T18:36:05+00:00">January 21, 2013</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

This is a good tweet.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>Some of the masters of Indian <a href="https://twitter.com/search/%23art">#art</a> are painting the walls of a gallery as part of an effort to ‘decommoditize art’ <a href="http://t.co/jkzLNaIO" title="http://bit.ly/TaxrQn">bit.ly/TaxrQn</a></p>&mdash; Livemint (@livemint) <a href="https://twitter.com/livemint/status/293395132705816578" data-datetime="2013-01-21T16:30:25+00:00">January 21, 2013</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Readable tweets gets clicks, RT and followers. Nuff said.

## 6. The Power of the RT
RT'ing others will get you followers. By RT'ing their content, you are doing
them a favor. When you do a favor, generally people feel compelled to do one in
return. This can lead to many followers.

    alt="A retweet." />

So hit the retweet button or use the RT in your tweet to give your two cents:

## 7. Don't Tweet Too Much.

From my own personal experience, people will unfollow you if you start tweeting
too much. So what is too much? 

It's hard to say. I've seen recomendations for as few as 5 - 6 tweets a day and
as many as 25 - 30. I don't think there's a magic number. If you can produce 30
quality tweets a day, than do it. If you can only produce 4 than thats fine.
Nobody will unfollow you if you're not tweeting. People will unfollow you if
your tweets are boring, irrelevant or annoying. So don't tweet for the sake of
tweeting. Tweet only when you have something great to share. 

## 8. Start Promoting Your Own Content.

Once you've start building that audience, start making your own content. Blog,
take pictures, make podcasts or videos and start sharing with the world. Be
sure to still share other's work but mix your own content in there as well.

If you get to this point, you will have a substantial following and be an to be
an actual authority, not just an authority on “finding stuff.”

Good Luck and Happy Tweeting!

If you’re anything like me, you love going to a good event. However, there is a
good chance you have the same problem I do when it comes to going to a good
event; sometimes they are very, very hard to find.

There is an all too familiar reason why upstart events have a hard time getting the word out:

- Marketing sucks.
- Finding the resources (time and money) is difficult.
- [Nobody knows how to do it].
- Marketing sucks.

If you’re someone who wants to run a killer event and actually get people to
attend, the following should help you get started.

## Determine Who You’re Marketing to.

It seems stupidly obvious, but really, sit down and figure out who will love
your event. Don’t ever say, “everyone will like my event” because that’s simply
not true. Create a profile of the person you are marketing to. Ask yourself
questions like:

* How old are your event attendees?

* Where do your attendees hang out (online and in the real world)?

* What are their likes and dislikes?

* How much money can they spend?

Answering questions like these will help you narrow down your marketing efforts, saving you time and money. Trust me, it will be the best 5 minutes you spend doing anything marketing related.

## Give Yourself Lots of Time 

Ever wonder why couples who are getting married often give themselves a year to plan their wedding? There are three simple reasons:

- Weddings have lots of moving parts to organize. 
- All those details takes a long time coordinate.
- The couple wants *almost* everyone to attend.

Most couples can’t pull off a typical wedding in less than 6 months without making large concessions. So if you think you can get 50 to 200 strangers to show up at your bootstrapped event in less time than that, you might be in for a rude awakening.

6 months to a year gives you the right amount of time to:

- Sure up a venue. 
- Get in the ear of potential partners to generate interest.
- Start informing those who you know will attend your event (and hopefully help spread the word).
- Tackle the big problems that your event will face. 
- Start your internet marketing campaign.

Which brings me too......

## 4 Tips for Internet Marketing.

### 1. Have a Website

Duhhhh.

If you, your organization or your business already own website, make sure you create a **separate page** for your event as soon as you create it.  

If you don’t have a website, [get one][wp]. 

It doesn’t matter if the details of your event aren’t ironed out before you site is up (location, time, ticket prices, etc). You want the name of your event up there as soon as you have it.

It’s unbelievably important to do this as soon as possible. The reason being, Google is watching what you put on the internet. Once your site, or page, exists on the internet, Google indexes it. You need Google to index your site in order for it to rise to the top of search results. And Google bubbling your site to the top of search results takes a few months. So get your site up there quick.

{ For advanced web people who want to make their site rise faster, [Google’s Webmaster Tools][webmaster] work very well. }

Lastly, make updates to your website ***as soon as you have them.*** An active site ranks well on Google. Also, Information about your event that isn’t online is about as useful as a screen door on a submarine. 

### 2. Use All of the Social Media

Social media is the easiest, cheapest and fastest way to create a dialogue with potential event go’ers. (Unless you’ve been living under a rock, you probably already know that). Here are the big ones to use:

**Facebook:** If you’re not on Facebook.....oh boy.....it’s time to join the rest of us. Get on Facebook. Most of you know how to use FB already, so I won't get into it. But in case you were wondering, there are some [good tips][tips] for promoting your event on FB.

**Twitter:** Ok, so there’s a good chance you don’t know how to use Twitter. Instead of explaining how to use it for your event, here are some resources that can explain it better than I:

- [Twitter 101] [101]
- [Use Twitter for Events] [twitevents]
- [Helpful tools to promote your event via Twitter] [promote]

**Googe +:** Yes.....that. G+ has half a billion registered users with 100M active. So it’s worth your time. Also, you want your event ranked on Google, right? Guess where Google is going to look first for appropriate content. Yup. Take a look at these:

- [Google + for Beginners] [gp]
- [Search Engine Tips for G+] [seogp]

### 3. Blog Early and Often

If you’re the type of person who thinks marketing is sleazy, blogging is just for you! When you blog about the stuff related to your event, it will bring event goers to you. It’s called [inbound marketing][inbound]. Here’s what you should do:

- Think about awesome topics related to your event.
- Write about them.
- Update your blog frequently.
- Make sure to link back to your event website. 

You’ll be surprised how many people are looking for your event on the internet.

### 4. Create Awesome Content

Make stuff people want to read. Add to the conversation, don’t be noise. This is true with any and all things you put on the internet.

## Price your Event Effectively 

Pricing your event might not seem like “marketing” per se, but it will be the #1 thing people look at when deciding if they’re attending your event. Remember that profile you created about the person you’re marketing to? Would he or she dish out the money for your event?

For example, if you’re trying to get college kids to attend your event, your $75 ticket price might be prohibitive. You might want to rethink things.

So how do you price your ticket? Creating your price is half science and half art.

### The Science of Price

You have your costs you need to cover plus whatever profit you might like to make. That number is usually pretty straightforward to create. 

### The Art of Price

This is where it gets tricky. When it comes to money, the first thing people will do is compare the price to something. Try to figure out what that will be. For example:

- Your play’s ticket price will be compared to other plays.
- Your concert or show ticket price will be compared to others.
- Your food event could be compared to a trip to a restaurant.
- Your running event will be compared to others.

And that’s just the beginning. I highly recommend reading [The 3 P’s of Pricing][p]. It explains the art far better than I can.

This is a long list, but far from exhaustive. Feel free to leave more advice in the comments.

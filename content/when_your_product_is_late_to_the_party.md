## A Hard Lesson in Pitching and Market Research

## The Beat Down

When you pitch, you learn things.

Fellow co-founder
[Kris](http://www.twitter.com/kixxauth)
and I went through some growing pains when we first came up with the idea for a
[community board for your phone](http://www.corkboard.mobi).
Pitching the idea was one of those areas that hurt a lot.

I watched Kris have this exchange with a Venture Capitalist:

> Kris: We’re working on a web app that works as a local community board.

> VC: Local huh? Man, everyone is doing local. It’s a crowded space. You’re probably a little late to the party. Good luck.

Good luck.

I’m relatively new to the startup game, but the way he said “good luck” was
familiar. It’s how my wife says it when I’m about to do something stupid. She
usually follows it up with an eye roll.

There was no eye roll from the VC, but the cadence was the same. He might as
well have said “enjoy eating Ramen for the foreseeable future fellas. I want
nothing to do with this traffic accident.”

## Hubris and Market Research.

We were convinced that the VC was wrong. I love local stuff. I love apps. I
don’t use local apps. There was no way he was right in his assessment. So we
decided to consult the internets on all things local.

We dug and we dug and we dug. And what we found made us mad. Not at the VC, but
at ourselves. He was right. EVERYONE is doing local.

The giants (Google, Facebook), want to influence your local decisions. The long
time established companies  (Yahoo!, Yelp, Meetup) are waist deep in all things
local. Search Google Play or the App Store and there are more locally centered
apps than you could possibly ever sift through. We found funded startup after
funded startup that were doing local in some fashion. Hell, even a technology
company I thought was dead (AOL) have their fingers in this very dirty pie.

Local is saturated. It’s a fact.


## Realities Disconnected

The preliminary research left me befuddled. On the one hand, every tech company
is trying to corner the local market in every conceivable way. There is no
debating it, their intentions are clear.

On the other, most of that technology hasn’t made much of an impact on my life.
In fact, if I want to find out what’s happening in my town, my first instinct
is to log onto my local newspaper’s rustic website. This can’t be right.

There’s clearly a disconnect.

Billions of dollars are being invested in building technology that should
improve and enhance the local experience. Yet, my first instinct is to go to a
website that was built 10 years ago with Frontpage.

So it begs the question: Am I the only one that is out of touch with all this technology?

## Ask the People

We needed this question answered. After much debate, Kris and I decided to
conduct a survey. We had our reservations, but we pushed forward with it.

We copied a surveying technique laid out by
[Dan Shapiro of Sparkbuy](http://fi.co/posts/608).
We built our survey and tested it 3 times on
friends and family. Once we had a final product we thought would answer the
questions we had and was as unbiased as possible, we sent it into the wild.

## What the Survey Told Us.
- The newspaper is still the most popular medium for keeping up with local events in people’s towns (7 out of 10 surveyed).
- Nobody uses local mobile apps. Seriously.....nobody. ( less than 1 out of 10 surveyed)
- Facebook and Google popularity fall somewhere in the middle of newspaper and apps, but they don’t have the impact that we thought they would have. (4 out of 10 surveyed)
- All other major technology (Twitter, Yelp, Patch, Yahoo!) are used, but not in a significant way. ( 2 out of 10 surveyed )


## The Lessons

First, thanks to the VC, we realized we can’t hunker down and build a better
mousetrap.  Like he said, we’re late to the party. Too much money has been
invested. We’re way behind in that regard. 

Second, after doing our survey, we did some more digging.
[Local newspapers](http://www.pewinternet.org/Reports/2012/Local-news-enthusiasts.aspx)
are still popular. News readers prefer
[browsers to apps](http://mashable.com/2012/10/01/mobile-tablet-news-consumption-study/).
And when you read between the lines, technology has
[disconnected the local information from the community as a whole](http://pewinternet.org/Reports/2012/Communities-and-Local-News/Summary-of-Findings.aspx).
Given the continued popularity of the newspaper, and the inconsistent results
of technology, nobody has solved the local problem yet.

Finally, if we’ve learned anything from the survey, it’s that we can’t
[interpret the results as gospel](http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2012/05/survey_bias_how_can_we_trust_opinion_polls_when_so_few_people_respond_.html).
Having this information doesn’t give us the keys to the next “big thing” in
local. But it does allow us to interact with our local communities (a novelty
in the technology business) and ask better questions, get better feedback and
build a better product.

There is no algorithm we can write, no design we can create, no UX we can slave
over, that will replace the real interactions we’re having with people in these
local communities. Thanks to the verbal beat down by the VC, and the subsequent
Market Research it spawned, we have a new vision for local. 

Some might think we’re late to the party. I don’t think the party’s started
yet.

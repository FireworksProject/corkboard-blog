A couple days ago I was playing around with the
[Google Trends](http://www.google.com/trends/)
tool while doing some market research for another project related to
[www.corkboard.mobi](http://www.corkboard.mobi).
If you're not familiar with it, you should check it out.  If nothing else, it's
a fun toy to amuse yourself with, and on a good day it makes a great market
research tool for your next venture.

Anyway, Corkboard is all about building vibrant communities, and for that to
happen we need to do our best to enable strong local economies.  And, without
the entrepreneurial piece of the puzzle, "vibrant" isn't really a word we can
use to describe our community.  When people in our local communities are
creating new businesses we believe that only leads to good things.

So, we're always looking for ways to grease the gears; so to speak.  And, one
type of grease we can use to get the entrepreneurial gears moving is
technology.  Specifically web and mobile technology are going to play a big
role in how local businesses are created and how they thrive into the future.
We've written about mobile, web, and small businesses in the past.  If you
haven't read it, you should check out our
[local renaissance](http://www.corkboard.mobi/blog/mobile_devices_local_marketplaces_and_small_business)
post.

So, while doing my research, I was curious about the Google search frequency
for different web building technologies.

The chart above plots the search frequency of "make a website" (blue), "google
website" (red), and "wordpress website" (yellow) since 2007.  You can play with
the
[interactive results](http://www.google.com/trends/explore#q=make+website,+google+website,+wordpress+website&date=1/2007+73m&cmpt=q&geo=US)
yourself at the Google Trends tool.

Notice that the generic term "make a website" (blue) peaked in the Summer of
2009 but has been declining ever since.  On the other hands, the more
specific web technologies, Google Sites and Wordpress, have been steadily
rising since 2007. Also, notice the little tick up in Jan 2013 at the end of
each of the lines.

I was curious about that uptick at the end, so I narrowed the results to Nov 2011 through Jan 2013.

Like before, you can play with the
[original source](http://www.google.com/trends/explore#q=make%20website%2C%20google%20website%2C%20wordpress%20website&geo=US&date=11%2F2011%2015m&cmpt=q)
yourself.
You'll notice that there is a sharp uptick in activity for these search terms
every January, but the most recent one for 2013 seams to be more pronounced.

Then I began to wonder if the frequency of people searching Google for ways to
create a new website might be a leading indicator of economic activity.  So, I
added in the generic search term "start a business".

<figure class="figure">
<img src="/images/content/google-trends-3.png" width="100%"
    alt="Google Trends results for 'Google website' and 'start a business' in last 14 months." />
<figcaption class="caption">

</figure>

Well gawl dang. The term "start a business" (red) matches in frequency
surprisingly closely to "google website" (blue). I guess we probably shouldn't
be surprised by that.

So, then, I thought maybe we should run the numbers on some search terms that
were the converse.  I came up with "find a job" as a possible example.

<figure class="figure">

<figcaption class="caption">

</figure>

Notice again that there is a spike in activity every January.  Also notice that
searches for "find a job" have been in a downward trend since the peak in
January of 2009.  It would take a lot more research to show this, but I'd like
to think that more people are finding a job they like, or even starting a new
business.  Of course it could also be true that some people who had been
looking for a job have given up, but let's look at the glass half full.

## What Have We Learned
Well, first I hope you've seen that Google search data can be a great tool for
exploring the market potential for your business venture, large or small.  It's
a first step to understanding how to market your business in a connected world.
I really encourage you to play around with it.

Secondly, while it's too early to say for sure, it looks like entrepreneurship
may be on the rise.  Starting a business may become a viable alternative to
searching for a job for more and more of us.  At Corkboard, we're even
observing that our
[Millennial generation prefers entrepreneurship](http://www.corkboard.mobi/blog/how_millennials_protest)
over getting a job and being a cog in the wheel.  I think that's good and
healthy for our communities.

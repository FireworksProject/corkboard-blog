# Mobile Technology: A Local Business Renaissance

I love blog posts that start out with a face-melting idea; those once-a-year,
jarring ideas that force me to question the decisions I’ve made in my life.
After I’m done reading that first mind-bending sentence, I’m super excited to
keep reading to have my life changed for the better.

Being a fan of these posts, I’d love to smack you upside the head in one
sentence with my breathtaking intellect. Unfortunately:

***”Everyone has a smartphone!”***

is a tad......underwhelming

But stay with me here for a second. If you’re a small business owner, the
implications of rampant smartphone are, actually, pretty face-melting.

The Cold Hard Facts
-------------------
Smartphones and mobile devices are changing the ways we interact with our
communities. This might not be readily obvious, but looking at some statistics
gives us a clearer picture of what these changes look like

I exaggerated about *everyone* having a smartphone. Obviously not everyone
does. However the trend of people adopting mobile devices is
[growing and growing](http://www.digitalbuzzblog.com/2011-mobile-statistics-stats-facts-marketing-infographic).

In fact, 43 people switch to a smartphone every *minute*. As this trend
continues, people will be
[accessing the internet more with their phone](http://60secondmarketer.com/blog/2012/07/19/how-people-use-their-smartphones-infographic/)
than with their laptop or desktop. 

These facts by themselves are interesting, but don’t exactly have that
face-melting effect. But when you consider that over half of mobile internet
use is
[locally centered](http://www.screenwerk.com/2012/10/01/google-50-of-mobile-search-is-local/)
, you might start [feeling the heat](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgYqIvnPvqQ).

The trend of smartphone internet use is going up. The trend of smartphone
internet use is increasingly about local stuff. Now consider that large dot
coms are toying with the idea of storefronts (seriously,
[an Amazon store](http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/amazon-to-launch-first-brick-and-mortar-store-report-says/2012/02/06/gIQADB5OuQ_story.html)
). They see that a physical location will be paramount in the
[survival of their company](http://adage.com/article/guest-columnists/time-dot-coms-start-thinking-inside-box/233368/). 

We, as small business owners, might find this scary. But remember, we’re
already on the ground. We have our stores. We’re embedded in the community. 

We have the advantage.


Mobile Brings Context to Local Businesses
-----------------------------------------
The reason for this remarkable trend towards local is due to the natural
progression of how we currently use the internet.

We hate not knowing. The internet has only fed into this. Every question, every
doubt, every inkling we have gets typed into a search engine and.... * pop *
....there’s the answer.

Mobile devices serve the same function, but are used differently than laptops
or desktops. Instead of searching the bowels of the internet to find the
funniest lolcats memes, people are using mobile to build context around our
local surroundings. 

If we see something around us that sparks curiosity, our natural response is to
pull out our phone and start looking for answers. 

For example, just this week I’ve found myself:

- searching “coffee” in Google Maps which will show me coffee shops near me. 
- logging onto Yelp to determine if the restaurant with the line is worth the wait. 
- looking at a store’s website outside before I walk in. 
- seeing a running race happening in front of me and searching to see what race it is.
- comparison shopping with my phone while in the store.

The phone feeds the hunger for knowing. It also acts like a town tour guide,
keeping me in the loop of every business and every event as it’s happening
around me. 

Mobile - Just the Beginning
---------------------------
Here’s the thing though, we’ve only touched the surface with how effective
mobile devices are. As much as I am singing the praises of mobile technology,
most small business owners
[still don’t see the point](http://www.pcworld.com/article/2011176/mobile-technology-important-to-small-business-but-lacks-relevant-uses.html)
. Mobile technology isn’t working for a lot of us and there isn’t much obvious value.

So there’s a disconnect and here’s why.

Large tech companies don’t understand the
[plight of the small business](http://dangerousminds.net/comments/facebook_i_want_my_friends_back).
They want to create one mobile product that works for everyone across all small
businesses. Unfortunately for them, every small business and small business
owner is different. Each business has different needs as well as different
methods of creating value from their product.  It’s nearly impossible to make
one product for all small business people.

Simply put, large tech companies aren’t building mobile technology that will
push small businesses ahead. 

So that leaves
[euntrpraneurs](http://abovethecrowd.com/2012/06/25/social-mobile-local-local-will-be-the-biggest-of-the-three/)
to pave the way. Needless to say, there are a number of small companies
attempting to create better local context and enrich local communities. But it
will take some time.

Moral of the Story.
-------------------
This blog post wasn’t meant to scare you if you happen to be less than tech
savvy. If you have queasy feelings that mobile is something you need to
shoehorn into your small business.....relax. You’re early to the party, not
late.

These are happy times. Face-melting, happy times.

> “You’re not the first person I’ve heard say you’ve never heard of us. Sometimes we artists live in a bubble.”

[Rachel Mello][r] is the Coordinator for 2013 [Somerville Open Studios][sos]
(SOS); the largest art open studio event in the country. The first weekend in
May, over 400 artists in Somerville open their studios up to the public to
broaden the exposure to, and appreciation of, finished works of art as well as
the art-making process.  By doing this, SOS’s persistent hope is to pop the
figurative bubble that seems to surround all of us.

Exposing other communities to your bubble is hard. It takes both guts and a lot
of planning. SOS has done a great job with both.

## How Artists Pop the Bubble

SOS’s approach is to open the doors and let people walk in and out of artists
studios for an entire weekend. While it could seem like you are walking from
art gallery to art gallery, SOS is not quite that.

“There’s a difference between walking into the [MFA][MFA] and participating in
an Open Studios event” Rachel explains. “At the MFA, or any other art gallery,
someone is there selecting what they believe to be good. At SOS, art is
unfiltered.”

It’s a daring way to expose the uninitiated public to the art community. 

“There is something profoundly important to having an unmediated experience.
Nobody has decided in advance whether the art you’re seeing is good or bad. You
can walk into a studio, look at something, think it’s shite and you can be
perfectly fine thinking it’s shite. But if you love it, you feel like ‘whoa I
genuinely love this and not because someone charged me $20 to see it.’” 

Most communities don’t have the guts to open themselves up like the art
community does in Somerville. Almost every large event you attend is curated in
some form. 

- The craft beer event only allows established brewers. 
- Large music events choose from hundreds of bands. 
- Food festivals choose from accomplished restaurants and chefs. 

Like any other major event, SOS surely wants you to have an awesome experience.
The question is, what kind of experience is that?

"Great art challenges us" Rachel goes on to say. "By providing an unmediated
experience, there is the real chance that the public will see something great."

Like is said before....these artists have guts.

## How Do I Experience Art?

The easiest answer I can give is: Ask questions. One of the benefits of an Open
Studios, is to gain a free education about art and the art process.

The beauty of open studios, as opposed to a traditional gallery, is direct
access to the artists themselves. In galleries, you might see something that
spurs a question. But the artist will not be there to answer. At SOS, you can
ask away. For example:

**Art context questions:**

- What am I looking at?
- Why did you make the piece a certain way?
- What inspired you to do this?

**Art creation questions:**

- How did you make that?
- What is that material that you used?
- Why do you use this instead of that?

**Artist specific questions:**

- What made you get into this?
- Is this how you make a living or is this just a passion of yours?

In the end, it’s events like these are about popping the bubble. Just remember, popping that bubble is a two way street.
